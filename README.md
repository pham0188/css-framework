# Welcome to Vintage CSS

Most modern CSS frameworks embrace minimalism, grids, and sans-serif clarity.  
**Vintage CSS** dares to be different. Inspired by vintage design, timeless typography, this framework offers an elegant alternative to the sleek, sterile look of today’s web.

With **serif-based headings but easy-to-read body paragraphs**, Vintage CSS brings back the charm of a bygone era—while still being responsive, lightweight, and developer-friendly.  

Whether you’re building a personal portfolio, a boutique brand site, or a storytelling project, Vintage CSS helps you create experiences that feel **crafted, timeless, and unique.**

> Step away from generic modern frameworks. Build with elegance. Build with Vintage CSS.
